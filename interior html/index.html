            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ yaâ€™ll, hola!

                My love for design started as a child in Belize, eagerly taking in any beauty I could search up around me, whether it was a rare fresh yellow bouquet in a friendsâ€™ home, or the pansies mom planted in front of our house when we lived in Canada for a season. It was rare to find special touches, as we come from a serious minded stalk who didnâ€™t spend much thought on beautifying their homes. 
                
                Our move to Costa Rica at 7 didnâ€™t increase the options much as we were working hard to just make a living. When our family business started doing well, we could start travelling more and we visited nearly every US state and Canadian province. 
                
                
                
                All of these countries and harder times have given me a diversity and the ability to design beautiful, creative homes within a small budget.
                
                
                
                I would love to work with you whether it is to declutter, design, remodel, stage or just give consultation in whatever it is that you or your business are ready for.
